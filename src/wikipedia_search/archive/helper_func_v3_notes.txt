Need to find a year
find a month and a day if they are there

how to do this?:

first number is either a year or day

month is first match to {months}


*** stop evaluating at 'or' 
*** don't consider anything in '[]'
*** don't consider anything in '()'
*** check for text 'AD' or 'BC' if year is found


pseudo-code

For all cells in [born or died] table row:
    how many number matches?:
        if == 1:
            is there a match with {months}?:
                if yes:
                    assign number to days 
                    assign word to months
                if no:
                    assign number to year
                    check for AD/BC and assign
                    
        elif > 1:
            assign first to year
            check for AD/BC and assign
            assign second number to day
            is there a match with {months}?:
                if yes:
                    assign month
                if no:
                    return an error
       
        else:
            is there a match with {months}?:
                yes:
                    assign match to month
                no:
                    pass


*** assert that day value is in range [1, 31]
*** assert that if day is given month is also given
